/* Why Function Names Matter

  there is one very important reason to care about function names

      Error Logs!

  when an error occurs in your code, the callstack will be logged
  if a function has a good and helpful name, the callstack will be easier to understand

  don't worry if you don't know what this is yet, head over to /errors to learn about this

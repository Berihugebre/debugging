## Before this Module

In the previous module ([welcome-to-js](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/welcome-to-js), 2 weeks) students learned some basic features of JS (variables, primitive types, conditionals, loops, prompt/alert/confirm), focusing on code comprehension. Exercises included commenting small programs, filling in blanks, and renaming variables.

## After this Module

In the next module ([behavior-strategy-implementation](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/behavior-strategy-implementation), 3 weeks) students will learn a structured approach to solving programming challenges. Besides reading and writing unit tests, students will also learn to analyze other people's solutions to coding challenges.

The primary new JS language features to be covered in the next module are array methods.
